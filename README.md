## üî® Usage
When started, the GUI is shown like the following: 

<p align="center">
<img width="500" src="./screenshots/lists.PNG"/>
</p>

Word lists are located under *lists/*, and you can add arbitrarily many custom word lists. 
All lists are equal, except the word lists under *TOEFL-categories/* and *show/*. 
When these lists are selected, the words are not hidden, and the displayed words will be changed every 15 seconds. 

The statistics are stored in the local MongoDB server, and the summaries are displayed for each list. 

Double click a word list, then you will enter the dictation environment. The questions are shown as the word being dictated is hidden and replaced by *__??__*
As you might have also noticed, the variants or the inflections of this word is also hidden. 

<p align="center">
<img width="500" src="./screenshots/question.PNG"/>
</p>
<p align="center" >  Word "test" and its plural form "tests" are hidden. </p><br/>

To answer the question, you simply enter the hidden words and press enter, and you can separate different words by spaces to answer in batch. 
- The correctly answered words or inflections are revealed. The others are still hidden. 
<p align="center">
<img width="500" src="./screenshots/inflections.PNG"/>
</p>
<p align="center" >  After "test" is typped in, the plural form "tests" is still hidden. </p><br/>

- If all hidden words are correctly answered, the dictation moves forward for a new word. 
- Or if the wrong answers add up to 3 times, the hidden words are displayed in red and the dictation taker should type all the correct answers to get the next word. 
<p align="center">
<img width="500" src="./screenshots/error-reveal.PNG"/>
</p>
<p align="center" > 3 errors lead to a reveal for all remained hidden words. </p><br/>

The audios are played every 15 seconds, to help you associate the pronunciation with the word and the word itself.
